**Loglizer is a machine learning-based log analysis toolkit for automated anomaly detection**.

Logs are imperative in the development and maintenance process of many software systems. They record detailed
runtime information during system operation that allows developers and support engineers to monitor their systems and track abnormal behaviors and errors. Loglizer provides a toolkit that implements a number of machine-learning based log analysis techniques for automated anomaly detection.

## Framework

![Framework of Anomaly Detection](/docs/img/framework.png)

The log analysis framework for anomaly detection usually comprises the following components:

1. **Log collection:** Logs are generated at runtime and aggregated into a centralized place with a data streaming pipeline, such as Flume and Kafka. 
2. **Log parsing:** The goal of log parsing is to convert unstructured log messages into a map of structured events, based on which sophisticated machine learning models can be applied. The details of log parsing can be found at [our logparser project](https://github.com/logpai/logparser).
3. **Feature extraction:** Structured logs can be sliced into short log sequences through interval window, sliding window, or session window. Then, feature extraction is performed to vectorize each log sequence, for example, using an event counting vector. 
4. **Anomaly detection:** Anomaly detection models are trained to check whether a given feature vector is an anomaly or not.

## Log data
We have collected a set of labeled log datasets in [loghub](https://github.com/logpai/loghub) for research purposes. If you are interested in the datasets, please follow the link to submit your access request.

## Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/logpai/loglizer.git
cd loglizer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## API usage

```python
# Load HDFS dataset. If you would like to try your own log, you need to rewrite the load function.
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = dataloader.load_HDFS(...)

# Feature extraction and transformation
feature_extractor = preprocessing.FeatureExtractor()
feature_extractor.fit_transform(...) 

# Model training
model = PCA()
model.fit(...)

# Feature transform after fitting
x_test = feature_extractor.transform(...)
# Model evaluation with labeled data
model.evaluate(...)

# Anomaly prediction
x_test = feature_extractor.transform(...)
model.predict(...) # predict anomalies on given data
```

For more details, please follow [the demo](loglizer-master/docs/demo.md) in the docs to get started. Please note that all ML models are not magic, you need to figure out how to tune the parameters in order to make them work on your own data.
